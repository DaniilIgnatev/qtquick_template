# Raw Requirements

requirements:
  - "We want a simple desktop app to demonstrate UI reactivity and basic interaction."
  - "The app should show a window with a 'Hello, world!' label."
  - "There should be four directional buttons (up, down, left, right) to move the label like a joystick."
  - "A separate 'Center' button should return the label to the center of the window."
  - "The UI should be clean, centered, and intuitive."
  - "The app is for demo and educational purposes only."
  - "The label should visibly move in response to button presses."
  - "The layout should make it obvious which button does what."
  - "(Optional) UI sketch: input_images/hello_world_joystick_sketch.png"
