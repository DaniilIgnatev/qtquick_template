# Example Input: Requirements Gathering

Stakeholder notes:
- "We need a simple desktop app to demonstrate UI reactivity."
- "The app should show a window with a label and a button."
- "When the button is clicked, the label should update to say 'Hello, world!'"

Context:
- The app is for demo purposes only.
- The UI should be clean and centered.
