# These goals express the core idea of the app

This is a demo application.

Purpose:
- I want to demonstrate to my collegues how Github copilot can help with development of UI applications.
- I want to leverage and show case the advantages of QML (declarative UI) paradigm.
- I want to cover the topic of battery management system (BMS).
- The result is a demo application following these goals and other intructions in the copilot folder.

Non-goals:
- No production-grade architecture.
- No communication to real device.
- No backend or API integration.
