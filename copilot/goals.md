# These goals express the core idea of the app

## Goals:
- I want to demonstrate to my collegues how Github copilot can help with development of UI applications.
- I want to leverage and show case the advantages of QML (declarative UI) paradigm.
- The result is a generated application following the goals, requirements and other intructions inside the copilot folder.

## Non-goals:
- No production-grade architecture.
- No communication to real devices.
- No sophisticated backend or API integration.

## UI
- Intuitive layout.
- Clean styling.
- Fluid design.
- Updates when data changes.
